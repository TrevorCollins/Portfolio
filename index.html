                <p>It's a T. It goes "tuh". Kids have names? I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
                <p>I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
                <p>Professor, make a woman out of me. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! I'm a thing. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
